## About Me

**Hey, I'm Yash Pundhir**

- I'm 23 and I live in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. I'm currently learning **Full Stack Web Development** in `MERN` Stack.

---

## Project Description

- In this project I have built a **Food Restaurant HomePage** from the scratch using core `HTML` & `CSS`

- The **most fascinating part** of the project is that how a `Gradient` can be blended with the `Background Image` to make the overall appearance more captivating.

- Note that I haven't made it **Responsive** to **Different Screen Sizes**, so it will work only on the laptop screen. If you are using Desktop, please zoom in or out, that might work.

## Technologies Used

- HTML

- CSS

---

## What I have Learnt in this Project

- Good Understanding of `HTML` & `CSS`.

- `float` property of CSS:

  - how the `float` property can be used to **align the corresponding elements on the screen wrt the position of the current element**.

- CSS Positions:

  - learnt about the **positioning** of different **objects and images**.

## Time Taken to Finish this Project

> I took around **2 hours** to complete this project. The only thing that has taken enough time to be implemented is the concept of **how to have a Background that contains a Gradient blended with the Background Image** in `CSS`.

---

I'm definitely more confident now in using a **Background that contains both a Gradient and a Background Image blended together** in my future projects.
